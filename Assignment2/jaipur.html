  <h1>Jaipur</h1>

  <p>Jaipur, popularly known as the "Pink City," is the capital of Rajasthan and one of India’s most famous tourist destinations. The city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II and is admired for its planned layout, with broad streets and symmetrical architecture, which was rare for its time. The nickname "Pink City" comes from the distinct pink-colored buildings in its old quarters, a tradition started in 1876 when the city was painted to welcome the Prince of Wales. Today, Jaipur blends the charm of its historic past with the vibrancy of a modern urban center.</p>

  <p>The city is renowned for its magnificent forts, palaces, and temples that reflect Rajput grandeur and architectural brilliance. Landmarks such as the Hawa Mahal, City Palace, Amber Fort, and Jantar Mantar (a UNESCO World Heritage site) showcase the artistic and scientific achievements of the era. The bazaars of Jaipur, like Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar, are famous for traditional jewelry, handicrafts, textiles, and blue pottery, making the city a paradise for shoppers and culture lovers. Jaipur’s streets and heritage sites are often bustling with tourists from around the globe, drawn by its rich history and royal heritage.</p>

  <p>Beyond its monuments, Jaipur is also a hub of cultural festivals and traditions. The annual Jaipur Literature Festival has gained international recognition, attracting authors, thinkers, and artists worldwide. Festivals such as Teej and Diwali are celebrated with grandeur, while the traditional Rajasthani folk music, dance, and cuisine add to the city’s charm. As part of the “Golden Triangle” tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra, Jaipur plays a vital role in showcasing India’s royal history. Despite modernization, the city has preserved its cultural roots, making it a unique blend of heritage and progress.</p>
