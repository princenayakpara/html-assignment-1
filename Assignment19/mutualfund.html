      The first introduction of a <a href="#">mutual fund</a> in <a href="#">India</a> occurred in 1963,
      when the <a href="#">Government of India</a> launched the <a href="#">Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI).
      Mutual funds are broadly categorised into three segments: <a href="#">equity funds</a>, hybrid funds, and debt funds.

    <h2>Mutual fund statistics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Key figures:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The total <em>Assets Under Management (AUM)</em> of the Indian mutual fund industry as of <strong>December 31, 2023</strong>
        stood at <strong>₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion)</strong>. This is a significant milestone, marking over a six-fold increase compared to
        <strong>₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion)</strong> recorded in December 2013.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to <abbr title="Securities and Exchange Board of India">SEBI</abbr>, during FY 2022–23, <strong>73%</strong> of mutual fund units were
        redeemed within 2 years of investment. Only investments in <strong>3%</strong> of the units continued for more than 5 years.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to the <abbr title="Reserve Bank of India">RBI</abbr> report, mutual funds attracted <strong>6%</strong> of household savings in FY2023 and less than
        1% went into direct equities. Almost 95% of household savings in India park their money in bank deposits, fixed deposit, provident fund, PPF, life insurance,
        and various small savings schemes.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to the S&amp;P SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximately <strong>68%</strong> of the large-cap actively managed funds failed to beat their
        respective benchmarks; over 50% failed to beat their benchmarks in mid- and small-cap segments. Within the ELSS funds category, over 60% failed to beat their
        respective benchmarks over a 10 year period. Globally, over long periods of time, passively managed funds consistently outperform actively managed funds.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="franklin-2020">2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco</h4>
    <p>
      In April 2020, Franklin Templeton India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4 billion, citing a lack of liquidity amid the coronavirus pandemic.
      These funds had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure
      and found “serious lapses and violations”.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund
      investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant another 50 million rupees. Franklin Templeton said it strongly
      disagreed with SEBI’s order and planned to appeal. The closure sparked panic withdrawals and court cases by distraught investors.
    </p>

    <h4 id="reliance">Reliance Mutual Fund</h4>
    <p>
      In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to exposure to troubled companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe
      redemptions and forced asset sales, significantly affecting investors.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ilfs">IL&amp;FS crisis and impact</h4>
    <p>
      The IL&amp;FS crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry. Defaults by IL&amp;FS led to downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations, causing distress in
      the financial markets and significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of affected schemes. This triggered liquidity concerns, regulatory responses and shifts
      towards higher-quality assets and improved risk management practices.
    </p>

    <h4 id="amtek">Amtek Auto Impact</h4>
    <p>
      Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced issues due to exposure to Amtek Auto (which defaulted in 2015). Some managers had to
      suspend redemptions and manage liquidity tightly.
    </p>

    <h4 id="birla">Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund)</h4>
    <p>
      In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to exposure to entities like the Essel Group companies; reports indicated
      considerable exposure across several schemes.
    </p>

    <h4 id="dhfl">Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact</h4>
    <p>
      The DHFL defaults affected the Indian mutual fund industry and highlighted issues around creditworthiness and liquidity. Downgrades and write-offs impacted NAVs, prompting
      regulatory scrutiny and reforms on issuer exposure and risk management.
    </p>

    <h4 id="uti-2001">2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco</h4>
    <p>
      UTI faced a significant crisis in 2001, primarily due to large-scale redemption pressures and mismanagement—exacerbated by market events like the Ketan Parekh scam. The government
      intervened, restructured UTI and later bifurcated it into separate entities to protect investors and stabilise the situation.
    </p>

    <h4 id="dhfl-pramerica">DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund</h4>
    <p>
      DHFL defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019, which led to governance concerns and impacted mutual funds that held DHFL securities. Several fund houses had to mark down values
      and face liquidity pressures as a result.
    </p>

    <h4 id="yes">Yes Mutual Fund</h4>
    <p>
      In 2019, Yes Bank faced severe stress and was placed under an RBI moratorium in March 2020. This affected mutual funds with exposure to Yes Bank’s securities, necessitating
      write-downs and impacting investor confidence.
